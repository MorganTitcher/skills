# Instrumentation: prove the UX works

## Why it matters
Without telemetry, you can’t tell whether the design reduces time-to-task,
reduces errors, or increases success rates.

## Checklist
- Screen view event includes: role, key filters, entry path.
- Key actions: create, update, bulk action, export, resolve.
- Funnel events for workflows (step completion, abandonment).
- Error events include: error type, surface, recoveries attempted.
