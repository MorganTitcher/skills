# Hierarchy: Attention maps (what must dominate, what must recede)

## Why it matters
If everything is emphasized, nothing is. Users miss critical status, misclick destructive actions,
and fail to notice constraints.

## Bad example
- Dense page where 12 cards compete equally.
- Primary action indistinguishable from secondary actions.
- Status is buried under decorative metrics.

## Good example
- Clear primary region: the “decision surface” (list/table + key statuses).
- Secondary region: context (inspector panel, history, notes).
- Tertiary: diagnostics, raw details, admin-only fields.
- Visual weight reflects decision priority, not aesthetics.

## Checklist
- Define Primary / Secondary / Tertiary regions.
- Only one **primary CTA** per scope (screen or panel).
- Status is near the object name and scannable (color alone not relied on).
- Important exceptions (blocked, urgent, failing) are surfaced with distinct affordances.

## Anti-patterns
- “Card salad” dashboards.
- Actions hidden in kebab menus for frequent tasks.
