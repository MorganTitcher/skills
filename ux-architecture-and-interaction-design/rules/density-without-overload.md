# Density without overload: “information compression” patterns

## Why it matters
Complex products need density, but density must be *structured*.
Overload comes from competing emphasis and lack of grouping, not from raw field count.

## Patterns
- Progressive summarization: show 3–5 key fields; hover/expand for rest.
- Inline pills/chips for categorical facts (status, tags, eligibility).
- Inspector panel for depth without losing list context.
- Saved views: users externalize mental models into named filters.

## Checklist
- The default view shows only what’s needed for the primary decision.
- Secondary facts are available with one interaction (hover, expand, panel).
- Scannability: the list/table can be scanned in <5 seconds for the top pattern.
