# Errors + recovery: never strand the user

## Why it matters
If users don't know what to do next, they stop trusting the product.

## Checklist
- Error messages:
  - explain what happened,
  - explain what to do,
  - preserve user input.
- Inline validation near fields + summary at top for long forms.
- Provide contact/support path for permission/entitlement errors.
